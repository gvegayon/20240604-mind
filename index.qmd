# Preliminaries {background-color="black"}

## Background

- Over a thousand long-term care facilities \[LTCFs] reached infection rates of 75% or more (year 1 of COVID-19) [@MoreThousandNursing].

- On average, over 1.7 million patients in the US acquired a Healthcare Associated Infection [HAI]. [@haqueHealthCareassociatedInfections2018].

- The estimated cost of HAI in the US for 2016 is between 7.2 and 14.9 billion USD. [@forresterCostHealthCare2022].

- The spread of pathogens within healthcare facilities is boosted mainly through contact with and movement of healthcare workers [HCW].

- Little is known about the structure of healthcare worker networks and how they relate to patient characteristics.


## Networks in Healthcare


- Most published work focuses on high-level summaries: overall contact rate, duration of contacts, and network-based measures like transitivity. 

- Analysis of the topology of the contact networks, especially as they relate to resident and HCP factors, has been limited.

- Most network studies focus on physicians, a handful incorporate other healthcare professionals, and most use projected networks, focusing only on physician-physician networks [@dugoffScopingReviewPatientsharing2018].

- @moenAnalysisPatientsharingPhysician2016 provides a large-scale analysis of patient-physician networks:

  - Use Exponential-Family Random Graph Models \[ERGMs] to assess assortativity between different types of healthcare professionals within two hospitals.
  - Used the physician-projected networks (a uni-partite version featuring physicians with ties representing shared patients)
  - This approach **discards any signal encoded in bipartite structures**.

## Data: Overview


::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- The data were collected through the [**CDC Epicenter program**](https://www.cdc.gov/healthcare-associated-infections/php/prevention-epicenters/index.html){target="_blank"} in collaboration with CDC Emerging Infections Program (EIP) sites in **seven states** (CA, GA, MD, MN, NY, TN).

- Twenty-five LTCFs were enrolled in the study.

- Data collection occurred in two units: One long-term care unit and one higher acuity care unit at each LTCF over two days.

- The data used in this study come from **interviews conducted at each enrolled facility** on each day of data collection.

- Key to this study: **using information about HCW-resident interactions to build bipartite networks.**

What micro-level **processes/structures**<br>are we **more likely** to observe in **these networks**?
:::

::: {style="font-size:80%"}

- Exponential-Family Random Graph Models \[ERGMs] are used to model social networks [@Robins2007; @Holland1981; @Frank1986; @Wasserman1996; @Snijders2006; and others].


- An observed graph $\graph$ is characterized by a set of sufficient statistics $\sufstats{\graph}$ and parameters $\params$. In a model that also includes node characteristics $\Indepvar$, this leads to the following probability function:

  $$
  \Prcond{\Graph = \graph}{\Indepvar} = \frac{%
    \exp{\transpose{\params}\sufstats{\graph, \Indepvar}}%	
  }{
    \kappa\left(\params, \Indepvar\right)
  },\quad\forall \graph\in\GRAPH
  $$ {#eq-ergm}

  Where $\normconst{} = \sum_{\graph\in\GRAPH}\exp{\transpose{\theta}\sufstats{\graph, \Indepvar}}$ is the normalizing constant, and $\GRAPH$ is the support of the model that is usually assumed to include all graphs of the same type (e.g., directed or undirected) and size, that do not include self-ties.

<!-- - In the directed graph case, the size of $\GRAPH$ equals $2^{n(n-1)}$ possible graphs. Making the exact calculation of $\normconst{}$, and therefore of \eqref{eq:ergm},  computationally expensive.

- A sophisticated array of parameters can be specified for ERGMs that reflect social and structural processes of interest to social scientists, such as social closure, connectivity, and other affiliation preferences.

- Although estimation of ERGMs is challenging, to this day, robust model fitting strategies are now widely available through community-developed software like the **statnet** collection of R packages [@statnet] and the **PNet** software [@wang2009pnet]. -->

- We use **statnet**'s' **ergm.multi** R package [@statnet;@krivitskyTaleTwoDatasets2023] to study the prevalence of various network structures associated with patient cohorting based on patients' characteristics

- We present one of the first applications of pooled bipartite ERGMs.

# Results {background-color="black"}

## Fitting multilevel ERGMs to Bipartite Networks

We encountered two issues worth highlighting.

1. Network-size heterogeneity plays a vital role in convergence.

    The presence of a relatively large network negatively impacted convergence. As a response, we followed a two-step approach:

    1. Fit the model without the outlier graph.
    2. Use the estimates of that fit as a starting point for re-estimating the model, including the outlier network.

    The inclusion/exclusion of the outlier did not significantly affect the parameter estimates.

1. Even in pooled models where network size heterogeneity could help, we experienced high collinearity between two-stars, concurrency, and geometrically weighted dyad-wise shared partners.[^seemore]

[^seemore]: For more on multicolinearity in ERGMs, see @vegayonPowerMulticollinearitySmall2023a, @krivitskyRejoinderDiscussionTale2023, and @duxburyDiagnosingMulticollinearityExponential2021.
  
  Our strategy was to fit separate models featuring each of these terms and keep the one that resulted in the smallest AIC/BIC.

## Model fit

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- The GWDSP effect is significantly negative, indicating a low chance of HCW overlapping residents.

- Residents under wound care/bedridden have more HCWs associated with them than other patients. 

- Resident-homophily: Residents share HCWs with others with the same care needs.

- Residents under ventilator care cluster around the same HCW.

- Observing two or more of the same type of HCW serving the same resident is less likely than expected by chance.

- No cohorting effect was observed among MDRO patients.

## Discussion

::: {style="font-size: 80%"}

- Most network applications in healthcare focus on **uni-partite networks** (projections), *e.g.*, physician-physician networks.

- Leveraging recent advances in multi-network inference, we present **one of the first applications of pooled bipartite ERGMs**.

- We found that
    1. Residents under wound care/bedridden have more HCWs associated with them than other patients.
    1. Residents share HCWs with others with the same care needs (ventilator and wound care).
    1. HCW assortativity (*e.g.*, two nurses for the same resident) is less likely than expected by chance.
    1. We found no evidence of cohorting among MDRO patients.

- Although cohorting is a common practice[^egdiseases], **measuring its effectiveness is challenging**, especially in endemic situations[@abadSystematicReviewEffectiveness2020].

[^egdiseases]: Generally, both patients and healthcare workers are isolated in the presence of infectious diseases, including Multiple Drug Resistance Organisms [MDROs] like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] Clostridioides difficile [C. diff] or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. 

- We can leverage information about network structure to design other studies, *e.g.*, agent-based models.

- Future work will focus on the **dynamics of these networks** (using temporal ERGMs) and how they relate to **pathogen transmission**.

# Appendix {background-color="black"}

## Data: Interviews

- HCPs working in the study unit were asked about their resident interactions between consecutive interviews about once every 60 to 90 minutes.

- They were assigned a non-identifiable study ID that was used throughout the shift to permit the linkage of multiple interviews from the same HCP.

- New IDs were given to all HCPs involved in the second round of interviews, making it implausible to associate first and second-round interviews.

## Data: Resident Data {.smaller}

- We collected standard patient demographics such as age, sex, race, and ethnicity. 

- We performed chart reviews for all residents in the two study units during the Epicenter data collection visits.

- The data abstracted included:

    - Whether the patient was admitted for a short stay,
    - Had diabetes,
    - Was receiving dialysis,
    - Was bedridden,
